MP1 v1.0

Program still not working as intended. As of now, the program can:
1. read images and transform it into a Graph object
2. perform the MST algorithm with the modifications
3. update Graph colors during MST algorithm's binding of component tree
4. update Graph edges during MST algorithm based on updated color
5. convert Graph object to an output image file (assuming everything above works correctly). The output.png displayed is only somewhat similar to the expected output, though not exactly the same.

Things to be implemented:
1. Everything already implemented though not correctly.
2. Will find the bug and fix it. 

Submitting for the meantime. . .
